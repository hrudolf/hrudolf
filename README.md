### Hey! Welcome to my GitHub site, my name is Rudolf.

I have started to learn coding in September 2022 to change careers and to be able to contribute to open source projects I believe in.

In 2021 I have translated Trezor Suite into Hungarian and have been maintaining it ever since.

My other hobbies include hiking, badminton and board games.
