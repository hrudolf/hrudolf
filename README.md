## Hey! Welcome to my GitHub site, my name is Rudolf and I'm a junior software developer, who just completed a Full Stack Development Course at Codecool.

I have started in September 2022 and have learned and used the following:
- JavaScript,
- npm,
- nodeJS,
- Express,
- React, React Router,
- Testing with Jest,
- MongoDB, Mongoose,
- C#,
- NUnit,
- MsSQL, PostgreSQL,
- ASP.NET Core,
- Entity Framework,
- Identity Management in .NET WebAPI,
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions,
- Docker, Docker Compose.

## My hobbies include board games, hiking, blockchain and contributing to projects I believe in.

I have worked on translating Trezor Suite into Hungarian, so that other Hungarians could use a hardware wallet for their future cold storage needs.
